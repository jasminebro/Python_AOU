#  Functions 

-   The most important method of code organization in Python (and R)

-   If you plan on repeating the same coding task at least 3 times it is worth writing a reusable function.

-   Functions are declare with the def keyword and contains a block of code with an optional return keyword.

```{python}

#test function

def my_function(x,y):
  return x + y 

```

-   Our test function above is named my_function, takes two inputs (x and y) and will return x+ y. Let's try our function.

    ```{python}

    my_function(4,5)
    ```
