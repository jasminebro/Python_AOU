# Working with Files

Why do we care about this?​

-   Data we typically get in the biological sciences are stored in files​

-   If you plan on writing scripts/software, you need to know how to read, write and extract information from files.​

-   Many biological files are stored in text files which are easy to parse and manipulate with python. ​

-   Sequencing Reads​

-   Quality Scores​

-   SNPS​

-   Phylogenetic Trees​

-   Geographical sample data​

-   Etc.​

```{python}

import pandas as pd
from pandas import Series, DataFrame

data = open("AOURuralSurvey.csv")

data_contents = data.read() 

print(data_contents)

df = pd.read_csv("AOURuralSurvey.csv")

df
```

-   Now, we have used pandas to open a csv file. Hoo Ray!

-   You can reference all of pandas IO tools to open, read and work with files.
